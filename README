NAME
    AnyEvent::Worker::DynamicPool - Auto-resizing worker pool for AnyEvent

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      # identical interface and behavior to AnyEvent::Worker::Pool
      $pool = AnyEvent::Worker::DynamicPool->new( 5, sub { ... } );
      $pool->do(@args, sub { ... });

      # alternate constructor arguments enable additional behavior
        $pool = AnyEvent::Worker::DynamicPool->new(
            workers => 5,
            worker_args => [ sub { ... } ],
            min_spare_workers => 2,
            max_spare_workers => 5,
            # additional args
        );

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new pool of workers. This module extends
    AnyEvent::Worker::Pool and adds dynamic resizing of the pool based on
    the workload and the settings specified when the pool was created. The
    settings for this module are inspired by Apache's pre-forking HTTP
    server settings controlling how child processes are managed
    (<corresponding Apache documentation>).

    Available settings:

    *   workers (default: 0)

        The number of workers to create on initialization.

    *   worker_args

        Arguments to pass to AnyEvent::Worker to create the worker.

    *   max_workers (default: "workers" setting, but no less than 1)

        A hard limit on the maximum size of the pool. This will be adjusted
        to match "workers" setting if it is not specified or if the value
        specified is less than the initial number of workers requested.

    *   min_spare_workers (default: 0)

        instructs the pool to always have this number of idle workers
        waiting for new jobs, will be set to 0 if it is not specified or to
        match the "workers" setting if it is greater than the initial number
        of workers requested.

    *   max_spare_workers (default: "workers" setting)

        instructs the pool to reap any idle workers above this amount, will
        be adjusted to match "workers" setting if it is not specified or is
        less than the initial number of workers requested

  most_workers_in_pool
    Returns the maximum size of this pool. Will always be less than or equal
    to the "max_workers" setting.

  num_available_workers
    Returns the number of available workers in this pool.

  can_expand
    Compares the total number of workers with the "max_workers" setting.

  needs_more
    Compares the number of available workers with the "min_spare_workers"
    setting.

  needs_less
    Compares the number of available workers with the "max_spare_workers"
    setting.

  take_worker
    Overrides AnyEvent::Worker::DynamicPool's "take_worker" method. Extra
    workers will be created if there are no spares and the total number of
    workers is not greater than the "max_workers" setting. The
    "min_spare_workers" setting will also be considered and additional
    workers will be created if the number of available workers is too low.

  ret_worker
    Overrides AnyEvent::Worker::DynamicPool's "ret_worker" method. Extra
    workers will be reaped after they finish a job if the number of
    available workers exceeds the "max_spare_workers" setting.
